# Step 1: Setting Up

Before we can write code, we need to set up our development environment.

## Instructions

1. Open your code editor
2. Create a new file called `hello.py`
3. Make sure your Python installation is working by running `python --version`

## Expected Output

You should see your Python version displayed, for example:
```
Python 3.11.0
```
