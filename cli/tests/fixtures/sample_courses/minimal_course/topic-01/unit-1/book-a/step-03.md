# Step 3: Experimenting

Now that you've written your first program, let's experiment with it.

## Instructions

1. Modify the program to print your name instead:

```python
print("Hello, [Your Name]!")
```

2. Run the program again

3. Try adding multiple print statements:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to programming!")
print("Let's learn together!")
```

## Challenge

Can you make your program print a simple ASCII art? Try something like:

```
  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *
```

Hint: Each line needs its own `print()` statement.
