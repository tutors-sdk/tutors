# Tasks: Comprehensive Test Strategy for Tutors CLI Tools

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-the-tutors-project/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: This is a testing strategy feature - all tasks involve creating tests

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `tests/`, `fixtures/`, `test_helpers/`, `baselines/` at repository root
- Paths shown below use single project structure per plan.md

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure needed by all user stories

- [ ] T001 Create project directory structure per implementation plan (tests/, fixtures/, test_helpers/, baselines/)
- [ ] T002 Create deno.json with imports for @std/assert, @std/testing, @std/html, zod, deno-dom
- [ ] T003 [P] Create fixtures/sample_courses/ directory structure
- [ ] T004 [P] Create fixtures/expected_outputs/ directory structure
- [ ] T005 [P] Create fixtures/schemas/ directory structure
- [ ] T006 [P] Create baselines/performance_metrics.json with initial empty structure
- [ ] T007 Create .gitignore to exclude test-output/ and cov_profile/

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure and utilities that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T011 [P] Create test_helpers/performance_tracker.ts with baseline comparison logic
- [ ] T012 [P] Create minimal sample course in fixtures/sample_courses/minimal_course/ (10 files: course.md, 2 topics, 1 lab, 2 assets)
- [ ] T013 Create fixtures/sample_courses/minimal_course/course.md with "Introduction to Programming" content
- [ ] T014 [P] Create fixtures/sample_courses/minimal_course/topic-01/topic.md for "Variables and Data Types"

- [ ] T017 [P] Add 2 small test assets to fixtures/sample_courses/minimal_course/ (image and PDF under 200KB total)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

- [ ] T039 [US2] Run tests for User Story 2 and verify all pass

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Regression Prevention (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Create a test suite that catches regressions when making changes

**Independent Test**: Run full test suite after code changes and verify no regressions occur

### Implementation for User Story 3

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (P1): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - US2 (P2): Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1 but independently testable
  - US3 (P3): Can start after Foundational - Uses baselines from US1/US2 execution
  - US4 (P4): Can start after Foundational - Integrates US1/US2 but independently testable
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May use US1 tests as examples but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Needs baselines established (can use US1/US2 as baseline sources)
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates all CLIs but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests can be created in parallel (different files)
- Sample courses before tests that use them
- Validation helpers before tests that depend on them
- Performance baselines before regression tests

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Within each user story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all test file creation for User Story 1 together:
Task T018: "Create tests/critical_paths/tutors_cli_test.ts"
Task T019: "Create tests/critical_paths/tutors_lite_test.ts"
Task T020: "Create tests/critical_paths/gen_lib_core_test.ts"

# These can run simultaneously - different files, no conflicts
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Core CLI Functionality)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run User Story 1 tests independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready (basic CLI testing functional)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (output validation added)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (regression protection added)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (full E2E confidence)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Core CLI tests)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Output validation)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Regression tests)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Integration tests)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- All tasks involve writing tests since this is a testing strategy feature
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
