## What is Tutors

Tutors is a collection of open source components and services supporting the creation of transformative learning experiences using open web standards. It consists of two key components:

- _Generator:_ transforms a [folder of learning content](https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-reference-course) into a Tutors course

- _Reader_: presents a Tutors course as an intuitive, discoverable and attractive [Web experience](https://tutors.dev/course/reference-course)

This repo is the Tutors Reader. A companion repo:

- <https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-apps>

...host the generators + support tools. These components are developed in the open by an active and friendly community, based on a [simple set of values](https://tutors.dev/course/tutors-reference-manual#tutors-values).

## Getting Started

The first step might be to become familiar with the course structure by [browsing a sample course](https://tutors.dev/course/reference-course), and then scan the [reference manual](https://tutors.dev/course/tutors-reference-manual). The manual will guide you through the process creating and publishing your own course (perhaps a copy of a sample). Thereafter you could scan the [Gallery of existing courses](https://tutors.dev/gallery) to get an idea as to how Tutors is used in practice.

Consider setting up your own [development version of tutors](#setting-up-a-tutors-development-environment) for experimentation.

## Reporting Bugs

We are delighted to get bug reports. If you encounter a bug, please open a [Tutors Issue](https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors/issues) with a description of the problem. Include information about the environment where the bug occurred, steps to reproduce it, and any relevant screenshots or error messages. Label the issue 'fix'. Perhaps do a quick scan to see if the bug has been reported - if so you might comment / react to the existing error (use filtering to see only '`fix` labeled issues).

## Requesting Features

If you have an idea for a new feature or enhancement, feel free to open a [Tutors Issue](https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors/issues). Describe the proposed feature, its benefits, and any other relevant details. Label the new issue `feature`. Perhaps do a quick scan to see if the feature has already been proposed and consider commenting / reacting to the feature instead of creating a new one (use filtering to see only '`feature` labeled issues).

## Setting up a tutors Development Environment

Make sure you have Node 18 + installed, and start by cloning this repo:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors.git
~~~

Open a shell and change into the project folder and run `npm install`...

~~~bash
cd tutors
npm install
~~~

Then copy the file `.env.example` to `.env`

Now to start the app you can run this command from the root:

~~~bash
npm run dev
~~~

This should launch the application:

~~~bash
  VITE v5.0.12  ready in 1069 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
~~~

Now the app is up and running and you can browse to it by opening the <a href="http://localhost:3000/">local location</a> in your browser.

The Tutors reader relies on a segment of the url to locate the course to display. Any of the [samples below]((#example-tutors-courses)) can be 'read' with an appropriate url segments appended to the local url you now have running. So for instance:

- <https://tutors.dev/course/reference-course>

... can be loaded locally by:

- <http://localhost:3000/course/reference-course>

(Note the port number 3000 may vary - see the launch console)

The 'source' for the above course is here:

- https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-reference-course

You could try any of the other sample courses above. For example this course:

- https://tutors.dev/course/full-stack-web-dev-oth-2022

can be opened by this local reader like this:

- https://localhost:3000/course/full-stack-web-dev-oth-2022

### Tutors Project Repos

There are 4 key tutors repos:

- [Tutors](https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors): The course reader application. This is a SvelteKit application, written in TypeScript with a user experience implemented using Tailwind & Skeleton.
