- ### What is Tutors?

  Tutors is a collection of open source components and services supporting the creation of transformative learning experiences using open web standards. It consists of two key components:

  - _Generator:_ transforms a [folder of learning content](https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-reference-course) into a Tutors course

  - _Reader_: presents a Tutors course as an intuitive, discoverable and attractive [Web experience](https://tutors.dev/course/reference-course)

  This repo is the Tutors Generators repo. A companion repo:

  - <https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors>

  ...host the primary Tutors Reader application. These components are developed in the open by an active and friendly community, based on a [simple set of values](https://tutors.dev/course/tutors-reference-manual#tutors-values).

### The Generators

There are three components making up the generators family of components:

- cli/tutors-gen-lib: A share library encapsulating the core Tutors course model, published to [npm here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tutors-gen-lib)
- cli/tutors-publish: The primary Tutors course generator producing a course for consumption by the Tutors Reader - on [npm here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tutors-publish).  
- cli/tutors-publish-html: A backup generator, which generators a static version of a course.

See the tutors manual for [guidance on using the generators](https://tutors.dev/course/tutors-reference-manual#publish ) command line applications.

### JSON Manager

There is a component in cli/tutors-json-manager that adds the capability to encyrpt and / or compress the JSON file. 

It's a simple standalone CLI tool but more importantly it standardises on a set of libraries and commonalities (such as base64 encoding) so that when this gets implemented in the reader application we can have consistency.
Arguments:
  file             JSON file to process

Options:
  --encrypt <key>  Encrypt the file with the specified key
  --compress       Compress the file
  --key <key>      Key to decrypt the file
  -h, --help       display help for command

  The rough compression saved % is printed out for convenience but we accept no liability for the accuracy!!

### Partykit

The Tutors Reader has a "live" feature, whereby students who share their presence appear on a real time dashboard summarising their current learning object interactions. This feature relies on the [Partykit](https://www.partykit.io/) service, and the tutors-party-kit service component here.
