# tutors-starter

A starter course structure for the tutors generator. This course is deployed here:

- <https://tutors-starter.netlify.app>

A local static version of the course can be built as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-starter.git
npx tutors-html
```

This will generate a web site in ./public-site.
