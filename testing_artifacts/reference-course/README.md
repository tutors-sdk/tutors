# What is Tutors?

Tutors is a collection of open source components and services supporting the creation of transformative learning experiences using open web standards. It consists of two key components:

- _Generator:_ transforms a [folder of learning content](https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-reference-course) into a Tutors course

- _Reader_: presents a Tutors course as an intuitive, discoverable and attractive [Web experience](https://tutors.dev/course/reference-course)

Tutors is developed in the open by an active and friendly community, based on a [simple set of values](https://tutors.dev/course/tutors-reference-manual#tutors-values).

This repo is the Tutors Reference Course - and can be viewed [here](https://tutors.dev/course/reference-course).
