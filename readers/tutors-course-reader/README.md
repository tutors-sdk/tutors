# tutors-next

A next generation reader for the [tutors-json](https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-json) static site generator.

Part of the [Tutors SDK](https://github.com/tutors-sdk) project, tutors-next is a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) application, which consumes JSON output from [tutors-json](https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-json), rendering an interactive experience. The application identifies the published course from a URL, recovers the JSON version of the static site and then renders a Svelte application.

The reader is intended for educational content, some representative examples:
