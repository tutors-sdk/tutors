# TutorsLive FAQ

**What is Tutors Live?**

_A companion to Tutors Time, this feature lists the students currently interacting with the module._

**What is is for?**

_The purpose of the feature is to simulate the presence dimension of a typical timetabled 'practical' in traditional module delivery._

**In what way?**

_In a practical session, students often work on their lab materials in a single physical space. They may work alone or collaborate - but they are at least aware of others in the room, and might have a general idea as to what fellow students are working on._

**Why might this be useful?**

_This experience can generate a sense of community and collective effort. It can also offer opportunities for mutual learning._

**What exactly does Tutors Live display?**

_Starting from from when you visit the course web - Tutors Live will list students who are interacting with the course - at topic level or below. It will list the topic name + the lab if interacting with a lab._

**Does Tutors Live show historical data?**

_No, the display starts when you visit course web. No interaction data is shown prior to this time._

**What happens when I leave the course web?**

_If no activity is detected for 5 minutes, then the entry for the student is removed from the display._

**Can I opt out?**

_Yes. In the top left of the Live display you will see an 'appear offline' checkbox. If you check this then you will not appear in the live display until you check it again. This will not affect other metrics._

**In the live display, my profile picture and name are incorrect?**

_These values are drawn from your GitHub profile - you can reset them there._
