# TutorsTime FAQ

**Can my data be seen by other students?**

_No - you can view your own data only._

**Is the data editable?**

_No - you can only browse the data_

**Why is this data being collected?**

_We are collecting this data largely for course management purposes. For example, time spent on lab steps is valuable intelligence that will feed into the design of the labs. Also, averaged lab times across the course will help us better understand course load and relative load across modules._

**Should I be trying to improve my numbers?**

_No, this information has no bearing on assessment. Lower/higher numbers reflect personal learning styles and interaction patterns - not necessarily learning achievements._

**What is the Labs data?**

_The number of minutes the lab is visible in the browser - excluding when the browser is minimised or in an inactive tab._

**What is the Calendar data**

_The number of minutes a page in the current module is open in the browser - excluding when the browser is minimised or in an inactive tab._

**Is this all of the data that is being collected?**

_For each learning resource (topic, talk, lab etc...), the number of visits + the time/date it was last visited is also recorded_

**Who can see this data?**

_The data is under the control of the primary module lecturer. He/she may share this with the course tuition team if appropriate._

**Will the data be used for anything else?**

_Anonymised versions of the data may be used for research purposes_

**If I think the data is inaccurate, what should I do?**

_You may be correct! - this is an experimental system. If you notice any anomalies please contact your lecturer_
